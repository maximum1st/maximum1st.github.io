  <h2>1. Message to Norihiro Ito (Continued on LINE)</h2>
<p>I'm done being friends. We just don't click. Give me back my trunk. I've been feeling bad about this for a while now. 
I guess that was just a hint of your feelings. You know, when you said "empathizing with others," I think you're being selfish. 
You never really consider other people. As expected, this was the result. You talk badly about others, but you're no different. 
Understand that your common sense might be nonsense to others. You always run away from troublesome situations. 
Thinking of friends as strangers, I think it's sad. Are you trying to upset me, looking down on me from above? 
You're too self-centered. Is my illness the cause? Arguing in private is not something friends do. 
If you had a problem, you should have clearly stated it. 

Speaking directly about what you disliked was too much, I was also holding back because I thought we were friends. 
I believed that being a friend meant to push forward no matter what the other person thinks, so I worked hard on the amp installation. 
In the end, it was all for nothing. It was a waste of time. There is no compassion in the emotions you show. 
It's as insane as feeding rice to a piece of paper. 

I was called when my ex-girlfriend was about to have surgery, but I went because I thought it was important. 
Now, I'm considering getting back together with her. She's the one who's there for me until the end. 
The lesson here is that even if you treat others like family, you're just being used. I don't need other people. 
You lack ambition, so you probably won't read this. But I'll write it down anyway. 

You care only about appearances. What's the point of caring only about how others perceive you? 
People who are only after profit appear to have ADHD. Return my trunk and tools because you're not the friend I was looking for. 
I'm not like you, who can afford a house with a pointless hobby. You said I could afford it, but I feel sick just from playing games. 
I'm also struggling. 

Even though you only care about appearances. Think a little more. Because I thought we were friends, I even told you my address when I was in trouble. 
Looking back, it was a mistake. I should have continued being a host. Are you good at deceiving people? 
Anyway, give me back my trunk and tools. It's not like I gave them to you. You should be the one to send them. 

Phew, you're probably badmouthing someone again. I mistakenly thought that the person I should never get involved with was my friend. 
I regret it. You probably pay back good and bad to people who are not beneficial to you. I regret thinking that you were a good person at heart. 
I feel like I've been hit by a scammer. If you understood the painful feelings of people who have to think for hours because of problems like this, you wouldn't have broken up like this. 

I will never be friends with you again. I care about my ex-girlfriend. Unlike you, she's someone I can have a good time with. 
You'll probably never become an understanding person like her. So, from now on, I'll cherish the time with her. 
I want to start a new life<p><br>

  <h2>2. Shops to Be Aware Of</h2>
<p>I brought my iMac for repair at PC Dock 24 Funabashi branch. The man at the counter had bloodshot eyes, which I found strange, but I proceeded with the repair request anyway. He asked me if he could proceed with the task ahead of time. At that moment, I found it rude, but not knowing any better, I agreed. I tried to call him several times but he didn't answer. I last called on Wednesday, a day before my final attempt to reach out before the start of the business day. The man, who seemed to be running the shop on his own, probably the manager, made discriminatory remarks, asking me if it was strange that he had received two phone calls. His words caused me significant stress, and I later had a seizure. He had a strange look on his face during the incident. Despite my distress, I decided to let it go.
  When I called on my way home, he again was confrontational for some unknown reason. Initially, I hung up the phone, but his behavior irked me so much that I decided to cancel my service request. I strongly advise against going to this shop as it seems to be run by a rather unstable person with a dual personality. The shop owner doesn't seem to care about losing customers and probably thinks he can get away with treating people poorly just because he has many clients. The fact that I'm naming the shop here shows how upset I was with his unwarranted accusations. It's unheard of for a shop assistant to get upset for receiving two phone calls. It was a bitter experience. I lost not only the train fare but also my energy. Carrying an iMac is no small feat. I'm documenting my experience here to serve as a record of what happened.
Even if things were tough, there is a certain level of service equality that should be provided. It's not okay to treat someone poorly just because they're a stranger. Well, I later found out that you're not supposed to call before business hours, but even so, I think his response was unacceptable. Because, after all, the shop has a responsibility to explain things to their customers. Smartphone Dock, which is in the same chain, offers proper service so don't confuse the two. Well, the monitor did come off after the repair, but they fixed it for me via cash on delivery, and I was satisfied.</p>

  <h2>3. (The True Nature of Norihiro Ito)</h2>
<p>He left a parting shot, saying, "I hope you find someone who goes along with your ideas, Ishige-kun." From this, it seems he never forced anything, yet he seems to have convinced himself that I was pressuring him based on phrases like "it hurt my feelings." I simply had to approach him as a friend. Because he constantly ignored me, I tried to communicate in a casual tone, asking, "Are you ignoring my messages on purpose? It's okay if you're busy, just let me know with a text." However, my words did not seem to get through to him. It seems he had convinced himself that I was being forceful based on prior events. It's a troublesome situation. Whether he has ADHD, common in psychopaths, is unknown, but his behavior could be considered as a kind of psychopathy. He creates a big issue by involving third parties and consults them to eliminate those who don't act according to his wishes, surrounding himself with those who do, seemingly for his own pleasure.
Normally, if a friend doesn't respond until you reach out, even on weekends, one would take action. The text I sent was just to check on him, but even the context seemed beyond his understanding due to his presumptions. He may be the embodiment of disaster, bringing misfortune to others behind their backs. Now that I think about it, Ito had a lot of troubles since junior high school. I used to think that the other party must have done something bad based on Ito's explanations, but thinking about it now, the rate of incidents was too high. Maybe the guy whose jaw was broken was also a victim like me. How pitiful. Psychopaths like this, who lack empathy and understanding, often end up in middle management positions in companies with bad atmospheres or black corporations, causing distress to their subordinates. It's not uncommon for intelligent people to mistake their bold gestures for competence, leading to their appointment as executives or presidents.
While Ito is not a significant individual, his followers are powerful. If you get involved, you may have many opportunities to meet various influential figures, and you never know what could happen. Therefore, returning to Choshi in Chiba Prefecture can be depressing. You never know what influential figures he might be able to pull strings with as he gets older. Since junior high school, he was the type to smirk after bullying others, so I don't trust him. Even when there was no action from him, I held back for many months and didn't force anything or do anything bad. He's a poor man who can't read the atmosphere. But maybe it's not pitiful because he lacks a heart.</p>
