  <h2>1.(Continued LINE message I wanted to tell to Norihiro Ito)</h2>
    <p>It seems our paths as friends are diverging. It's apparent we're not compatible. I'd appreciate the return of my trunk; it feels like I've been accommodating for too long. It's essential to consider that seeing things from others' perspectives isn't solely about your interpretation.

I foresaw this outcome, and it's disheartening to see us here. Remember, judging others often reflects back on ourselves. Escaping from troubles never resolves them. Friendship is valuable, and it saddens me to treat friends as strangers. Accusations of hurt feelings from a high ground – what were your intentions?

It's unfair to blame my illness for this strife. Friendship isn't about squabbles over trivial matters, and if you're genuinely my friend, being straightforward is the way to go. The things you found bothersome were too direct, things I held back out of respect for our friendship.

I believed friends should confront each other, which is why I put effort into setting up that amp. Unfortunately, it seems it was a waste of time. I now understand that the kindness I've extended to you was like feeding rice to paper.

I was there for you when I had my own pressing matters, because I valued our friendship. Now, as I consider reconciling with my long-term partner, it's clear that they're the ones who stick around. The lesson learned is that treating strangers like family only leads to being used; true companionship doesn't come from everyone.

I don't expect you to understand this, given a lack of ambition. Still, I feel compelled to write. Focusing only on superficial matters holds no real value. People who chase only self-serving interests might as well be living in their world. So, I kindly request the return of my trunk and tools. I'm not fortunate enough to indulge in trivial hobbies. I may seem at ease, but even gaming takes its toll on me.

Think more deeply. I trusted you enough to share personal details in tough times. Looking back, maybe that trust was misplaced. Perhaps deceit suits you better?

In any case, please return my belongings; they were never meant to be a gift. Send them back at your expense. I regret ever calling someone like you a friend. If you didn't intend to be benevolent, I wish you had been clear from the start.

To reflect on this more, if you truly understood how much thought I've put into this issue, you'd realize that it's not just about the petty reasons you gave. You made me feel worse than you claimed to feel, which seems incredibly unjust. I've suffered more from this ordeal, and there was never any coercion involved.

The issue isn't simple; if it were, why would there be such resentment? It seems you had been planning to sever ties for a while. That makes you cold-hearted. Despite the pain it may bring, our friendship existed, and I read the air as I thought a friend would. Why should I be the only one to tread lightly? Your lack of emotional control and insight is now apparent, and it's sad to recognize it so late.

Anger and disappointment can lead to harsh words, but remember, I have no ill will, just no warmth left for someone who ranks friends. Returning to my hometown now feels dreadfully bleak. Although you might have influential acquaintances, true relationships aren't transactional. I'll proceed straightforwardly, even if it means going it alone.</p><br>

  <h2>2.（It's prudent to be cautious with certain stores.）</h2>
  <p>I took my iMac for repairs to PC Dock 24 in Funabashi. When I caught the eye of the man at the counter, his bloodshot eyes made me think something was off. He bizarrely asked if he could pre-work on my device without explaining what that meant. At the time, not knowing any better, I agreed. However, repeated calls to the shop went unanswered, including one the day before and another just before opening on the day of the repair.

When the man, likely the owner, emerged from the shop, his comments were off-putting and discriminatory, making me feel extremely stressed, leading to a physical reaction. His demeanor was quite unsettling. Despite the discomfort, I decided to let it go, but another bizarre and confrontational call upon my return led me to cancel the service altogether.

I advise against visiting this shop; the behavior there suggests a duality in character that's quite perplexing. It felt as though the owner doesn't respect his customers, taking them for granted. I'm mentioning this to record my experience. Regardless of the situation, one expects a certain level of equitable service which was not provided. This was not about expecting divine intervention, just common decency and respect.

I later learned it's improper to call a business before it opens, but that does not excuse the poor service I received. A business has a responsibility to explain its processes to its customers. While Smartphone Dock, which appears to be related, provided satisfactory service, this was not the case at PC Dock 24. My monitor even came loose after their repair, though they did fix it without charge. Overall, a very disappointing and frustrating experience.

  <h2>3.（The True Nature of Norihiro Ito）</h2>
   <p>He left with a parting shot, "I hope you find someone who suits Ito's liking." From this, it seems he's drenched in his own delusions, as I've never forced anything on him; yet, he accuses me of causing offense. All I did was try to bridge the gap of silence, suggesting if he's too busy to respond, just a word would do. But he took even those words wrong, convinced I was imposing on him.

He's the kind to stir up drama, seeking only those who dance to his tune, excluding anyone who doesn't. A normal friend would reach out if silence persisted over weekends, but not him. It's like he's a walking calamity, blindly roping in others into his chaos. Reflecting back, troubles seem to follow Ito since middle school; I've always thought others were at fault, but maybe they were just like me—victims.

Individuals like him, possibly struggling with a psychopathic kind of ADHD, often end up misunderstood as competent by their confident demeanor, only to wreak havoc as middle managers or worse, as executives, leaving their subordinates to suffer. Although Ito isn't anything special, his influential entourage is concerning. Who knows what could happen in Choshi, Chiba when he grows older and gains more power?

I have patiently endured months of inaction from him, never coercing or doing anything wrong. He's just a poor soul who can't read the atmosphere. It's hard to feel sorry for someone so devoid of empathy.
